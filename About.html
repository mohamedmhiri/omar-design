                The African market is considered a considerable asset with great potential for exploitation;
                <br> For example, sub-Saharan Africa will have the largest global growth in terms of import volumes over the
                next five years.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, it will have a strong wave of urbanization (from 472 million people in 2015 to 1.4 billion in 2050)
                and a growth of the middle class (a surety of 125 million people between 2015 and 2024) that change the landscape
                population of the region.
                <br>
                <br> Depending on this, Tunisia is likely to be able to benefit from these transformations:
                <br>3 of the 5 main products imported by Africa are also included in the top 10 of Tunisian exports. This competition
                allows students to view the African market as a promising market in the future.
                <br>
                <br> It also allows them to show their creativity and share innovative ideas with a well-targeted audience (African
                experts). The student or the young entrepreneur or start-uper can through such competitions to confront the
                professional world and promote his ideas to investors on the continent.
                <br>
                <br> This will be able to present Tunisia as incubator countries for young Talent in ICT "African Hub of ICT".
